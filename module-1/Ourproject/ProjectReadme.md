Goals
The goal of this project was to make a recommedation to Microsoft as to which type of movie they should produce as their foray into the Hollywood movie market.  We each analyzed a certain metric, cleaned the data, and performed analysis on each of the data sets.  We as group decided which data sets to analyze and assigned project responsibilities to each member.

Lidet Alemu was responsible for Rating, Reviews, and Movie Length.  She chose a data set from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB.

Joseph Hart was responsible for total revenue and popularity by genre.  He chose 3 data sets including IMDB.

Charles Pryor was responsible for analyzing total return on investment(ROI) by genre.  He chose 2 data sets to analyze.

The files included in the repository are all of the group members working notebooks at various points during the progress of the project.  There is also one final technical notebook that is cohesive of all of progress showing the steps we as group made towards finalizing this project and making appropriate recommendations.  A PDF of the presentation slides is uploaded as well.

Thank You.
